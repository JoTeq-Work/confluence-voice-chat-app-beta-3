Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code readability.  2. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by avoiding duplicated code.  3. Use strict mode to enforce stricter rules for writing JavaScript code.  4. Always declare variables with the 'let' or 'const' keywords to avoid global scope pollution.  5. Use arrow functions to write concise and readable code.  6. Avoid using the 'eval' function as it can introduce security vulnerabilities.  7. Handle errors with try-catch blocks to prevent the application from crashing.  8. Use proper indentation and formatting to enhance code readability.  By following these best practices, you can write clean, maintainable, and efficient JavaScript code for your web applications.Changes to this page by Virendra"
